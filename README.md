# Powershell_1_offs
some random unorganized stuff I put together for doing various things in powershell

Current List:
1. Get-UnicodeCharacter - converts and searches for the hex values assigned to characters. Got it to work in reverse, too!
2. Tshark thingy - makes it where you can use a whole directory of pcap files with tshark... no extra tools necessary!!
